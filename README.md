# ðŸ“Š Agent Performance Summary Tool

This project was completed as part of an internship assessment. The goal is to analyze call center data and generate an agent-wise performance report for a specific day.

ðŸ§¾ Project Objective

This project processes and analyzes call center performance data to generate a daily summary of agent activity. It merges three core datasetsâ€”call logs, agent roster, and disposition summaryâ€”to compute key metrics per agent and highlight top performers.

The solution includes modular, validated, and extensible code with CLI support and logging.


ðŸ“Œ Objectives:

Merge and analyze agent activity across multiple sources.

- Calculate metrics like:

- Total calls handled

- Unique loans contacted

- Completed calls

- Average call duration

- Agent presence

- Connect rate

- Identify the top-performing agent for a selected date.

- Save the summary as a CSV file and visualize insights with plots.

Tasks:

1. Data Ingestion and Validation:
Read all 3 files into pandas.
Ensure call_date, agent_id, and org_id are present and correctly formatted.
Flag missing or duplicate entries.
2. Join Logic:
Merge the datasets using agent_id, org_id, and call_date.
Ensure no data loss in joins; explain how you handled mismatches.
3. Feature Engineering:
For each agent on each date, compute:
Total Calls Made
Unique Loans Contacted
Connect Rate = Completed Calls / Total Calls
Avg Call Duration (in minutes)
Presence (1 if login_time exists, else 0) Agent Summary for 2025-04-28 Top Performer: Ravi Sharma (98% connect rate) Total Active Agents: 45 Average Duration: 6.5 min

---Output:
Save the report as agent_performance_summary.csv
Format a Slack-style summary
